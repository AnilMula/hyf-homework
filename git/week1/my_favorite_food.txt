fried chicken

Ingredients
4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 tablespoons garlic salt
1 tablespoon paprika
3 teaspoons pepper, divided
2-1/2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
2 large eggs
1-1/2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
2 broiler/fryer chickens (3-1/2 to 4 pounds each), cut up
Oil for deep-fat frying
Directions
In a large shallow dish, combine 2-2/3 cups flour, 2 tablespoons garlic salt, 1 tablespoon paprika, 2-1/2 teaspoons pepper and 2-1/2 teaspoons poultry seasoning. In another shallow dish, beat eggs and 1-1/2 cups water; add 1 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1-1/3 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Dip chicken in egg mixture, then place in the flour mixture, a few pieces at a time. Turn to coat.
In a deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Working in batches, fry chicken, several pieces at a time, until golden brown and a thermometer inserted into chicken reads 165°, about 7-8 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels.

Test Kitchen Tips
A thrifty alternative to purchased garlic salt is to mix up your own: Just combine 1 teaspoon garlic powder with 3 teaspoons of table salt or other fine-grained salt. The ratio works the same for onion salt, too.
Yogurt is a classic chicken marinade in Greek, Indian, North African and Middle Eastern cuisines. Its relatively gentle acidity (compared with lemon juice or vinegar) means it won’t make the meat fibers tough from over-marinating the way that stronger acids can. The lactic acid in yogurt penetrates deeply into the meat without breaking down muscle fibers. It works much like buttermilk, which is another classic dairy-based dip, mildly acidic, that’s perfect for fried chicken.
